    //for(initialization; conditional statement; increment/change)
    
    //Complete the following challenges using BOTH a for loop and a while loop

    //1 - print all the integers 1 - 10, inclusive of both



    //2 - print all the even integers between 1 and 1001



    //3 - print all numbers divisible by 3, starting at 99, going from largest to smallest.
