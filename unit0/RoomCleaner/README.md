# Clean the World

For this lab, our robot will act like a roomba. It will pick up all the piles of beepers in a room. It will
keep track of information as it does its task. It must clean up every location in the room. User
must be prompted for the room to clean (world file to be read in) as well as location and direction of
the robot's initial state.

Information to be reported back to user:

- Area of room
- Number of piles
- Total number of beepers
- Largest pile of beepers
- Location (relative) of the largest pile
- average pile size
- percent dirty (piles/area)

I have provided a template and a world to test. Because we are at the initial stages of learning to
program and test, I am providing the test world. It is a good idea to consider the test cases that
may break your code, and try to test these cases during development.
