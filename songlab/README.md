# Song Lab

## notes:
- use scanner class to count the number of lines, divide by 4, use that number to set the size of the array

## GC instructions: 

We will be investigating some of the top songs from 1965 - 2015.


Using the file attached, download and put it into your project (I will link VSCode and Replit projects tomorrow). You are to read in the data from the file INTO your project (using whatever method you like...yes we will talk about how this week).


Format:
song_name
artist
year
number_of_words


Once you have the data, you are to analyze and come up with the following:


- Total number of songs
- Average number of words per song 
- Song with the most number of words
- Song with the least number of words 
- Artist with the longest name 
- Artist that appears the most number of times (must be exact match) 
- Does any song appear more than once? (must also be exact match)
